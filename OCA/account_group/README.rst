Installation
============

If you have already the chart of accounts loaded on your company, you will
need to update it through the module `account_chart_update`. Follow the
instructions on that module for that.

Configuration
=============

To configure account groups, you need to:

#. Be "Account / Adviser" role.
#. Go to *Invoicing/Accounting > Configuration > Accounting > Accounts Groups*.
#. Create or modify existing groups.

For assigning groups to account templates, you have to:

#. Set the group on your account chart module or extension.
#. Or develop/create UI access.

When you have groups on your account templates, you can load a chart template
for a new company, and they will be transferred to created accounts.

Usage
=====

For assigning groups to accounts:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Adviser > Chart of Accounts*.
#. Edit one account and set "Group" field.
